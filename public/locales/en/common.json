  "whyZipplingDescription": "Zippling was created based on real experiences of struggling to find housing in Vancouver.\nAs a developer and as a foreigner myself, I — along with many others — faced difficulties navigating unfamiliar housing systems in a new culture.\n\nWhen people don't understand each other's norms or ways of communication, a barrier of information naturally arises.\nZippling was born to break down that barrier and help others make better choices with confidence.",
